# national-rail-web-proxy

## Scknowledgements
Lots of the heavy-lifting in this project is derived from [@mattsalt](https://github.com/mattsalt)'s excellent [*national-rail-darwin*](https://github.com/mattsalt/national-rail-darwin), which provides an object-oriented method of proxying Darwin, more suited to static apps and other environments lacking the stringent security requirements of client-side apps.
